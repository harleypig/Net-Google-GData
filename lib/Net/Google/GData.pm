=head1 NAME

Net::Google::GData - Handle basic communication with Google services

=head1 VERSION

  This document describes v0.02 of Net::Google::GData - released December 25, 2012 as part of Net-Google-GData.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

THIS MODULE IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE

I fixed what was causing cpantesters to barf. I don't think the API this was written for is even valid anymore.

Net::Google::GData handles the basic communication details with Google services.

This module should normally only be used by modules subclassing GData.
