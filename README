NAME
    Net::Google::GData - Handle basic communication with Google services

VERSION
      This document describes v0.02 of Net::Google::GData - released December 25, 2012 as part of Net-Google-GData.

SYNOPSIS
    THIS MODULE IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE

    I fixed what was causing cpantesters to barf. I don't think the API this
    was written for is even valid anymore.

    Net::Google::GData handles the basic communication details with Google
    services.

    This module should normally only be used by modules subclassing GData.
